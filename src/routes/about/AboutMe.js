      I am a highly skilled Front End / Back End Developer coupled with a keen enthusiasm for Design Patterns, learning and using new technologies. I have a passion for breaking down complex technical concepts and presenting them in an understandable format to various audiences. My interests lie at the intersection of algorithm design techniques and optimization, where I am passionate about developing efficient solutions to complex computational problems. I'm Interested in design and implementation of programming languages , theory of computation (formal language theory, computability, classic and unconventional models of computation), Big Data, Distributed Processing, Data Mining, Learning from large DataSets, Advanced Topics in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, functional programming, Natural Language Processing (parsing, mathematical developments and applications, pattern interpretation, tree-controlled grammars), statistics, Startups. I always prefer to write tests for my code and use tools to automate development process. I believe that Open Source improves life of all developers, so I create some open source projects at GitHub. 

Programming Languages: 
 C, C++, Rust, Scala, Java, Python3 (Data Science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit- learn), Ruby, Go, PHP, Kotlin on Android, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, Haskell, LISP, Prolog, R for Statistics and Machine Learning AI.
